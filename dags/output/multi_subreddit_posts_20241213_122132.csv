"What AMP/DAC to get for Audeze GX, Monarch MK3 and Sennheiser 650",273,1dqy18v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1dqy18v/what_ampdac_to_get_for_audeze_gx_monarch_mk3_and/,23,2024-06-28 19:59:29,inflationkore,"Hi guys,

I've tested nearly every high end headphone there is (focal utopia, focal stellia, focal clear mg, etc) at a local store on a $5k usd amp and found all of them to be snake oil and I really didn't enjoy them.

After going home and spending hours reading all of your reviews on this sub heavily recommending the Monarch MK3 due to its fantastic bass (i love bass), I ended up biting the bullet and bought the Monarch MK3. I really enjoyed them. However, they hurt my ear canal, cost $1k usd and I'm seriously worried about hearing loss due to how far they go into my ears and hurt. So I'm now looking to get my hands on the Audeze GX and the Sennheiser 650, to protect myself from any chance of hearing loss. I've also heard fantastic stuff about those 2 headphones, and the price is very reasonable compared to the other $3k+ snake oil from focal

And I've read that an AMP/Dac is a 'must' for the Audeze GX and the Sennheiser 650, but after testing so much snake oil I'm of course very skeptical. So i'd like to know the cheapest AMP/DAC I could get away to run these 2 headphones to their full potential without any snake oil that costs $4000 for nothing.

Please let me know!

  
EDIT: My PC has a high end Dark Hero maximus motherboard, so not sure if a DAC is really necessary or just an AMP, but here's what the description says: ""**Immersive Audio**: ROG SupremeFX ALC4082 codec with ESS^(®) ES9218 Quad DAC for up to 32-Bit/384 kHz playback"". Let me know if I should get both a DAC/AMP or just an AMP.",HeadphoneAdvice,"[{'text': ""The Monarch won't cause you hearing loss unless you listen at really high volume.

Get a 3.5mm to RCA cable. Plug the line out on the back to the AMP's RCA and see how it works. Another cheap option is getting the Apple Dongle ($8) which works as a DAC. Its a usb-c to 3.5mm jack. So you will still use the same 3.5mm cable to RCAs to the amp. \n\nand if you still feel like you need more, then you could buy the matching DAC for each of these amps (Atom DAC 2 or Modi  -both $129) \nAlso something to note - you can get the Drop HD6xx headphones.

PSA: Hifiman headphones are not on sale,120,1f56nfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1f56nfv/psa_hifiman_headphones_are_not_on_sale/,17,2024-08-30 17:26:06,snow2462,"I have seen a lot of people trying to get a new pair of headphones and stumble upon HIFIMAN sale. They usually see the price are 50% or 80% off depending on the headphones.

THESE ARE NOT SALE PRICES.

HIFIMAN has the practice of permanently reducing their headphones prices while still displaying the slashed original price to label as “On Sale”.

For example: the HE1000 Stealth Edition price was permanently reduced to $1399 last year. On Headphones.com, they are displayed as on sale. This is to trigger FOMO in buyer to get more sale.

If you have Firefox or Chrome, then install Keepa extension and check the price on Amazon. You can see the price of these headphones was reduced last year. Even though I like HIFIMAN headphones, this should be a good head-ups for beginners who want to get a good pair of Headphones.

The gaming headset I got was a Corsair HS80 wireless and for the price (£100) it did not sound very good , mainly for gaming, when hearing footsteps.

So I returned it and typed on Google on best headphones for FPS games and a post from this subreddit popped up and it mentioned that don’t buy anything with the name gaming on it and also had the BT 990 pro as a suggestion.

So I bought it , despite all the tech YouTubers usually suggesting to buy gaming headphones.

Today it arrived and I plugged it straight into the MB without an AMP/DAC

It sounds so good , I can hear the footsteps so clear and crisp and can easily pin point where it’s coming from.
