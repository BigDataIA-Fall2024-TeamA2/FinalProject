**YOU ARE NOT ON A JOURNEY WITH HERMES.** **You are just trapped in a marketing ploy** designed to make you spend dozens of thousands of dollars on trinkets you don't really want before you get a bag that *may* be the one you asked -- but more often, will not, so that you keep spending.

**Your SA is not your friend** and does not like you -- why would they like someone who spends several months of an SA's salary on overpriced shoes and ashtrays? Their goal is to extract as much money from you as they can, to fund something much more meaningful -- the salaries of people who actually need to work for a living.

And please consider this -- some people do get a Herm√®s Birkin or Kelly just by walking into the shop, because the brand thinks that they fit their image. If you don't get one immediately, you're not on a journey -- **you're just not their type**. They'll keep you waiting and spending, sometimes forever.

I wish people on [TheHermesGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHermesGame/) came to realize this.

**EDIT**: for people asking, the ""Herm√®s journey"" is how some Herm√®s's customers describe the fact that they have spent dozens of thousands of dollars on trinkets, shoes, ashtrays... before being offered the ""right"" to buy a Kelly or Birkin handbag, whose price vary between $10,000 to $50,000. Quite often, the bag offered does not match what they asked for so they keep spending, hoping that the next bag will be the right one, etc.

**EDIT2: This thread has been locked by the Mods for Crowd Control reasons.**

**EDIT3: Herm√®s' customers who play** [**TheHermesGame**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHermesGame/) **have expressed discontent at this post on their own Subreddit, pointing out that they have the right to spend dozens/hundreds of thousands of dollars as they please as it is their own money.

Half way through chemo gift from my husband,5816,1getr30,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1getr30,206,2024-10-29 08:47:27,SeaInsurance3536,"I‚Äôve admired luxury bags for my entire life - my mum had an amazing luxury wardrobe that I would spend hours trying on. But I‚Äôve only just now been able to start investing in my own pieces. 

My first purchase was my Gucci horsebit cross body bag that I was gifted for my birthday this year from my husband. And I‚Äôve worn it almost everyday since, love love love this bag. 

I‚Äôve always wanted a Louis Vuitton Neverfull and I‚Äôm just a sucker for LV in general. I either choose a small cross body bag, or a large tote style bag, don‚Äôt really have any in between. So I knew my next purchase would be something similar. I don‚Äôt know why I could never pull the pin on a Neverfull, something about it didn‚Äôt seem special enough for me. So I started searching for something a little different, but still a similar size bag. I‚Äôve been searching my favourite luxury resellers for months, and recently came across this absolute beauty - Louis Vuitton Long Beach in Vernis Amarante. In near perfect condition! I sat on it for a few days and my hubby said go for it - surely I deserve something nice for all the chemo I‚Äôve been pumping through my veins üò≠üòÇ

Anyways the bag arrived today, the condition is even better than I thought it would be. The only slight markings are on the feet of the bag, other than that it‚Äôs perfect! And I am in love.
