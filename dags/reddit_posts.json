I told her I didn't want anything at all for Valentines, just have a chill day. Got her some flowers and small gifts here and there for her and our dogs. She originally boxed up a pair of those mall slipper Diors and I was excited to wear them around the house... Came upstairs to this insane cop by her... Still mind blown lol.",
